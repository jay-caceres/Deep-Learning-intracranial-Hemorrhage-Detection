# Deep-Learning-intracranial-Hemorrhage-Detection
In this project, We use machine learning algorithms to detect if 
there exists an intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) in computed tomography 
(CT) scans and identify its subtypes. To achieve this, we implemented 
three machine learning models using the RSNA ICH dataset in hopes of 
finding a good model in achieving a high accuracy detection score
